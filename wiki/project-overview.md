# Project Overview

## Introduction

The NestJS Course Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to manage educational courses, student enrollments, and appointment scheduling. The system provides a robust backend infrastructure for educational institutions to handle their course management needs efficiently.

## Objectives

- Provide a centralized platform for course management
- Enable efficient student enrollment and tracking
- Facilitate appointment scheduling between students and instructors
- Implement role-based access control for different user types
- Ensure secure authentication and authorization

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture built on NestJS, utilizing the following key components:
